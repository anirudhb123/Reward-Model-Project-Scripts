Adjust the response to make it more elaborate and expressive while preserving all original meaning. Expand descriptions naturally while maintaining factual accuracy. Avoid overly technical language, jargon, or complex phrasing—ensure the response remains clear and accessible to a broad audience. Do not add speculative details, new information, or unrelated metaphors. Keep the tone natural, engaging, and easy to understand.
