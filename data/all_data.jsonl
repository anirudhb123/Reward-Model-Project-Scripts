{"query": "SecureSolutions, a company specialising in installing security systems, sells and maintains security systems for shopping malls. In the current system, several CCTVs are set up so major shoplifting hotspots are visible in a control room and mechanisms are available for shop staff to signal the control room if they suspect a shoplifter. If a possible case of shoplifting is detected, an operator in the control room will contact the senior security guard on duty and call the police at the same time. The system is being used by several customers and is working better than their previous system. However, customers have indicated a few problems with this arrangement. There are three main difficulties: the police are being called out unnecessarily; the senior security guard cannot always respond immediately, and when the control room alerts the senior guard the offender is sometimes alerted as well and has time to make their escape.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions is exploring a change to the system such that each security guard on duty has a mobile communications device which can be tracked in the mall by the control centre. This means that when a possible case of shoplifting is detected, the operator in the control room can alert the nearest security guard, quietly, with the location and nature of the possible offence. The communications device can also be used to alert police at a nearby police station if the case requires police intervention.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions initiate a change proposal.\nFrom a service management perspective:\na. Decide and explain if the proposed change is primarily:\na routine upgrade?\na response to a problem?\nan extension of the service portfolio?\nin effect, a change in service supplier?"}
