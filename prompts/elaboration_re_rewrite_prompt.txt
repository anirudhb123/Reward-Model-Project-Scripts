Adjust the response to make it more concise and to the point while preserving all original meaning. Remove unnecessary words, redundancy, and overly elaborate phrasing. Keep the response clear, direct, and easy to understand without losing key details. Do not remove important context or change the factual accuracy of the response. The goal is to make the response as efficient as possible while still answering the question fully.
